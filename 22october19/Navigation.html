		<p> Since early 2012 we’ve been monitoring a range of non-traditional sources, searching for links and references to published research.Altmetrics can showcase the attention and influence of research
Altmetrics are often referred to as if they are a single class of indicator, but they’re actually quite diverse and include:

A record of attention: This class of metrics can indicate how many people have been exposed to and engaged with a scholarly output. Examples of this include mentions in the news, blogs, and on Twitter; article pageviews and downloads; GitHub repository watchers.
 Today the Altmetric database contains 60 million mentions of over 9 million research outputs (including journal articles, datasets, images, white papers, reports and more), and is constantly growing.

		Altmetrics are metrics and qualitative data that are complementary to traditional, citation-based metrics. They can include (but are not limited to) peer reviews on Faculty of 1000, citations on Wikipedia and in public policy documents, discussions on research blogs, mainstream media coverage, bookmarks on reference managers like Mendeley, and mentions on social networks such as Twitter.

Sourced from the Web, altmetrics can tell you a lot about how often journal articles and other scholarly outputs like datasets are discussed and used around the world. For that reason, altmetrics have been incorporated into researchers’ websites, institutional repositories, journal websites, and more.

Here, we’ve compiled a primer on altmetrics to help you understand what they are, why they are useful, and how they should be used.

Altmetrics are often referred to as if they are a single class of indicator, but they’re actually quite diverse and include:

A record of attention: This class of metrics can indicate how many people have been exposed to and engaged with a scholarly output. Examples of this include mentions in the news, blogs, and on Twitter; article pageviews and downloads; GitHub repository watchers.

A measure of dissemination: These metrics (and the underlying mentions) can help you understand where and why a piece of research is being discussed and shared, both among other scholars and in the public sphere. Examples of this would include coverage in the news; social sharing and blog features.

An indicator of influence and impact: Some of the data gathered via altmetrics can signal that research is changing a field of study, the public’s health, or having any other number of tangible effects upon larger society. Examples of this include references in public policy documents; or commentary from experts and practitioners.

Each of these different dimensions can tell a much more nuanced story of research’s value than citation counts alone are able to.</p>
<h3>Advantages to using altmetrics
</h3><div class="about"><img src="images/7.png" height="300" width="300"></div>

<p>Altmetrics have a number of advantages over citation-based metrics:

They are quicker to accumulate than citation-based metrics: By virtue of being sourced from the Web and not from journals and books,it’s possible to monitor and collate mentions of work online as soon as it’s published.
They can capture more diverse impacts than citation-based metrics: As described above, altmetrics can complement citations in that they help you to understand the many ‘flavours’ of impact research can have.
Altmetrics are becoming widely used in academia, by individuals (as evidence of influence for promotion and tenure and in applying for grants), institutions (for benchmarking a university’s overall performance), libraries (for making collections management decisions and understanding the use of IR and digital library content), and publishers (to benchmark their journals’ performance in specific subject areas) alike.

They apply to more than journal articles and books: Researchers are sharing their data, software, presentations, and other scholarly outputs online more than ever before. That means we can track their use on the Web as easily as we can for articles and books.

	<h2>Web Development</h2>
	<p>Altmetric is an analytical tool which allows users to track and analyse online activity around scholarly literature. As an author, you can measure the online impact of your research, and as a reader, you have quick and easy ways to see which papers are receiving the most attention.

All articles in journals from BMJ will now feature the Altmetric donut (see above) showing each article’s Altmetric score and a breakdown of its coverage on social media sites, blogs, newspapers, magazines and more. Readers can click on the donut to see more details, including a full list of all tweets relating to that particular paper.

In light of this, BMJ has compiled a list of the Top 12 Open Access articles from BMJ gaining the most attention in social and digital media over the past year, which can be found on our Rebelmouse page. The page will also be pulling in top tweets from the #oaweek hashtag.

<p>figshare
A repository where you can upload your research outputs to make them citable, shareable and discoverable. You can upload files in any file format, which allows you to disseminate research outputs you may not have in the past, such as figures, datasets, media, papers, posters, presentations and file sets. Any item you make public on figshare will be allocated a DataCite DOI, which means it can be cited. Figshare also records how often items have been viewed or shared, and you can browse or search for the most viewed or shared items. Free service.
The University of Melbourne instance of figshare
If you use the University of Melbourne instance of figshare, you can use the figshare interface, and all your data is operated from and stored on the University's data storage infrastructure.
Dryad
A repository where you can deposit the data underlying your scientific publications and make it discoverable and citable. Your data can be embargoed until your related articles are published. Dryad keeps track of data package views, file views and downloads. Accessing data is free for researchers and institutions, however there is a one-off data-set publishing cost of $90 or more (depending on size and other factors).
GitHub
An online repository for sharing code, with distributed revision control and source code management functionality. GitHub users can recommend code by giving it star, or can fork the code, and tools like Impactstory gather these metrics. Registration is free.
SourceForge
An online repository for open source software projects. You can use SourceForge to develop, download, review, and publish open source software. Users can give projects ratings, reviews or recommendations, which can be used as altmetrics, along with the number of downloads. Using SourceForge is free.
SlideShare
A website where you can upload and share your presentations, infographics, documents, videos, PDFs, and webinars. SlideShare records the number of views for each item. Slideshare requires registration but is free.
YouTube
A free platform for sharing and watching originally created videos. Altmetric aggregators such as ImpactStory, Plum Analytics and Altmetric collect metrics from YouTube. Metrics can also be hand collected such as the number of comments, likes, dislikes, favourites and views.
Vimeo
A free platform that allows users to upload and view videos. Possible metrics include the number of likes, plays, comments, mentions (the number of topics in a forum discussing the artefact) or captures (the number of people who have subscribed for an update). Plum analytics and ImpactStory collect metrics from Vimeo.</p>

History
Altmetric was founded by Euan Adie[8][9] in 2011.[10] Previously a researcher, Adie had already worked on Postgenomic.com, an open source scientific blog aggregator[11] founded in 2006. In 2011 Adie entered an altmetrics app into Elsevier’s Apps for Science competition and won.[12][13] The prize money enabled Altmetric to develop a full version of the Altmetric Explorer, released in February 2012.[14]

In July 2012 Altmetric took on additional investment from Digital Science[1] and is still a part of the group today, with offices in London, Germany, the United States and Australia.

Concept
A term first coined in the altmetrics manifesto in 2010,[9][15] altmetrics (also known as ‘alternative metrics’) were developed to provide authors and other stakeholders a more comprehensive record of engagement with scholarly work, particularly that which takes place beyond the academy amongst a broader audience. In order to do this, Altmetric tracks a range of online sites and sources looking for ‘mentions’ (links or written references) to scholarly outputs (which include journal articles, blogs, data sets and more).[16] Sources of the attention include the mainstream media, public policy documents, social and academic networks, post-publication peer-review forums and, more recently, Wikipedia and the Open Syllabus Project.[17]

The data are tracked in real-time and collated in the Altmetric details pages, which provide a clickable summary of all of the online attention relating to a single research output.

The Altmetric Attention Score and Donut Badge
Altmetric employs an algorithm to assign each item an automatically calculated score. Based on the volume and source of attention an item has received, the score is intended to reflect the reach or popularity of the research output. A multicolored ‘donut’ visualization is also generated to provide a summary of the sources of the attention that an item has received (red for news, light blue for Twitter, etc.).[18][19] Altmetric make the data available via the Altmetric Bookmarklet, a browser plugin, the Explorer platform, a cloud-hosted database, and API.

The sources include academic citations and academic platforms, patents, posts on social media and web forums, Wikipedia articles, users on Mendeley.[20]

Many publishers, including John Wiley & Sons, Taylor and Francis, The JAMA Network and Springer Nature embed the Altmetric ‘Donut’ Badges into their journal article and book pages to show the Altmetric score for individual items from within the publisher platform.[21][22][23][24] Even though there is no clear link between altmetric scores and societal impact, they can be used to predict future citation impact ,[25] and may be a target for manipulation.[26]
